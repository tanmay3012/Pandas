# Python Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains two data analysis projects demonstrating data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“Š Project 1: Customer Call List - Data Cleaning
This project cleans a messy customer call list to prepare it for use.

Key Actions: Removed duplicates, standardized text fields, formatted phone numbers, parsed addresses, and filtered out records marked "Do Not Contact."

## ðŸŒŽ Project 2: World Population - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores a world population dataset to uncover trends and insights through data analysis and visualization.

Key Actions: Inspected data structure, analyzed correlations between demographic variables, grouped data by continent to compare growth trends, and created plots (heatmap, boxplot, line plot) to visualize the findings.
